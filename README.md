# airplane-seat-timeseries
Builds time series data for individual seats on specific flights.

## Roadmap
Vertical slice for downloading and structuring a single, specific flight (of a particular airline):
* Make valid request to correct flight endpoint
* Store raw response in database
* Parse response into structured data

Other tasks:
* Install Playwright for python (done)
* Test use with target API endpoints
